## whoami
I'm Sean, a secondary school student from Hong Kong who's interested in all things programming. I'm part of the CTF team [Black Bauhinia](https://ctftime.org/team/83678/), and have done independent security research. Other than infosec, I also enjoy being a hobbyist full stack developer and a competitive programmer.
